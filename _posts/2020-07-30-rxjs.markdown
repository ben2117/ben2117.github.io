# rxjs

a few years ago I discovered I really liked linq. so when angular comes along with heavy use of reactive extensions that made me happy. Thank you for reading my lifes story.

### useage

The typical use case of reactive extensions seems to be dealing with asynchronous data over time. And people seem say, use rx in these cases and in other cases you dont need them.
I do not have enought experiance to comment on that ethier way, but reactive programming is not a new thing, even before observables for user input I was taught at uni "reactive" programming existed in a much less modern sense.
